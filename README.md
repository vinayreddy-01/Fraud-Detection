## Project Overview
This project involves developing a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions for a financial company. The aim is to analyze transaction data and identify potentially fraudulent activities to enhance security and prevent financial loss.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project consists of 6,362,620 rows and 10 columns. The columns include:
- **step**: Maps to time in hours, representing a 30-day simulation.
- **type**: Transaction type (CASH-IN, CASH-OUT, DEBIT, PAYMENT, TRANSFER).
- **amount**: Transaction amount in local currency.
- **nameOrig**: Customer initiating the transaction.
- **oldbalanceOrg**: Initial balance of the originator.
- **newbalanceOrig**: New balance of the originator after the transaction.
- **nameDest**: Recipient of the transaction.
- **oldbalanceDest**: Initial balance of the recipient.
- **newbalanceDest**: New balance of the recipient.
- **isFraud**: Indicates if the transaction is fraudulent.
- **isFlaggedFraud**: Flags transactions attempting to transfer more than 200,000 in a single transaction.

## Objectives
- Conduct data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values and outliers.
- Develop a fraud detection model using appropriate machine learning algorithms.
- Analyze the performance of the model and derive actionable insights.

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**: Address missing values, outliers, and multi-collinearity.
2. **Feature Selection**: Use domain knowledge to select relevant features for the model.
3. **Model Development**: Train various machine learning models to identify the best-performing model.
4. **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
